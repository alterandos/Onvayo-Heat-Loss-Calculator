# Onvayo Heat Loss Calculator

## Description
The Onvayo Heat Loss Calculator is designed to automatically calculate the heat loss of a heated space, a group of heated spaces, or an entire building. Inputs are sourced from German regulatory bodies or measurements from the buildings/rooms themselves, which are provided by customers. All calculations comply with German regulations.

The primary goal is to enable the advisory on heat pump installations for customers' homes or other buildings. It's important to note that this project will be integrated with a separate customer-facing frontend code.


## Usage
For now, you can refer to the excel file located in the `/docs` folder for detailed information on the required inputs for the calculator.
